# üöÄ Demo
To retrieve the last month's tournament results (a specific Collection):
```javascript
// Retrieve the monthly results in reversed order and take only 1
let apiResponse = PssFleetData.Client.getCollections(null, null, "month", true, 0, 1);

// The resulting response object will have the http response code and if the request was successful, also the parsed response body
if (apiResponse.metadatas != null) { // Check for null, the result set may just be empty
  // Now retrieve the Collection's full data with the collectionId
  let collection = PssFleetData.Client.getCollection(apiResponse.metadatas[0].collectionId).collection;
  
  if (collection) {
    console.log("Last month's collection was collected at: " + collection.timestamp);
    console.log("Last month's collection took " + collection.duration + " seconds");
    console.log("Last month's collection has " + collection.alliances.length + " alliances");
    console.log("Last month's collection has " + collection.users.length + " users");
  }
}
```
The library converts localized `Date` objects to UTC or assumes UTC, if no timezone information is given. Any `Date` objects returned are in UTC.
